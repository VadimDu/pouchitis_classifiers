# pouchitis_classifiers
Dysbiosis in metabolic genes of the gut microbiomes of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases

The code used in the manuscript to generate a machine learning model, i.e. pouchitis classifier, to distinguish between patients with a pouch phenotypes (normal pouch vs. pouchitis) based on bacterial speceis, metabolic pathways or enzmes profiles from shotgun metagenomic data. 
In addition, after training the classifier on the discovery cohort (patients with a normal pouch and with pouchitis, N=208 samples), the classifier can be used to predict which patients with samples defined as recurrent-acute pouchitis phenotypes (from the validation cohort, N=42 samples), will become normal pouch (disease improvement) or pouchitis (disease aggravation) in follow up clinic visits. The prediction performance were: accuracy of ~ 76.2%, sensitivity of 88.9% and specificity of 53.3%.
